# Parameter-Cheap-CNN
In this project, I have built a CNN architecture and developed a training strategy with the goal of achieving an accuracy of 80% while keeping the number of parameters below 50,000.
To fine-tune the model's performance, I have applied various regularization techniques during the training phase to find the optimal gradient and prevent overfitting.
